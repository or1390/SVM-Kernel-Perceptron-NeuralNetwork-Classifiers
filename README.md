# Mini-Project 2 - kNN and Perception algorithms
#### This project consists on implementation of three algorithms: Neural Network, Support Vector Machine and Kernel Perception.
#### The dataset used to train and test the models is MNIST. 


#### In the main.py file, we do:
* Data reading and preprocessing


* Neural Network-algorithm


* Support Vectort Machine- Pegasus Paper


* Kernel Perception
